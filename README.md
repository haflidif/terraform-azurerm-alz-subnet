# terraform-azurerm-alz-subnet

# Description
This module is used to deploy subnet with network security group (NSG) and route table (RT) associated as workaround to the `azurerm_subnet` resource so it doesn't conflict with the Azure Landing Zone policies [`Subnets should have a Network Security Group`](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyadvertizer/Deny-Subnet-Without-Nsg.html) and [`Subnets should have a User Defined Route`](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyadvertizer/Deny-Subnet-Without-Udr.html) which are commonly used within large/medium sized enterprises in the [Azure Landing Zone Reference Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/landing-zones/terraform/landing-zone-terraform?wt.mc_id=SEC-MVP-5005265).

# Why
Why not just use the terraform resource `azurerm_subnet` to deploy the subnet within the virtual network deployed by the e.g [Azure Landing Zone vending module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/lz-vending/azurerm/latest) ?

That is because it's known for having a bug that conflicts with these `deny` policies due to how the resouce is designed, and how it's not able to associate the `Network Security Group (NSG)` and the `Route Table (RT)` to the subnet when the resouce is deployed, due to those restrictions in the resource it needs to use seperate resources for that action `azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association` and the `azurerm_route_table_association` but unfortunately that conflicts with the `Deny` policies and doesn't allow you to create the subnet.

The only way to deploy a subnet that doesn't conflict with these policies is to use the `azurerm_virtual_network` resource to deploy the subnet and reference the network security group, and the route table in one API call. 

However, that only resolves the part of the problem as the `azurerm_virtual_network` resouce doesn't support complex configurations on the subnet like `Subnet Delegation`, `Service Endpoints` and `Private link-/ endpoint network policies` 

In addition to prevent autonomous work teams/owners/contributors of their Landing Zone to create a subnet within their own code repository, and constant need to involve the Platform Team to create the subnets for the landing zones.

### Issues that have been previously been posted and resolved with workarounds on this bug when creating subnet while adhearing to these policies.
These github issues have been around since mid 2019, some of them have been resolved with workarounds, workaround similar to what is being used in this module, and some are still open.

- `delegation_service_name` - (Optional) Provide the service name for the subnet delegation configuration.
  > :information_source: **NOTE:** <br>
  > Delegating to service may not be available in all regions. Check if the service you are delegating to is available in your region using the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet?view=azure-cli-latest#az-network-vnet-subnet-list-available-delegations()&wt.mc_id=SEC-MVP-5005265). <br>

- `service_endpoint_names` - (Optional) List of service endpoints to associate with the subnet, multiple service endpoints are supported.
  > :information_source: **NOTE:**
  > <br>
  > In short Service Endpoints are used to secure Azure service resources to use the virtual network instead of the public internet, utilizing the azure backbone network. Multiple Service Endpoints can be defined on each subnet. <br>

  **Generally available service endpoints for all regions are:** <br>
  `Microsoft.Storage`, `Microsoft.Storage.Global`, `Microsoft.Sql`, `Microsoft.AzureCosmosDB`, `Microsoft.KeyVault`, `Microsoft.ServiceBus`, `Microsoft.EventHub`, `Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory`, `Microsoft.Web`, `Microsoft.CognitiveServices` <br>

  `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry`

Defaults to `false`, when used in combination with `create_sub_network_resources` and `nva_ip_address` this should be set to `true` to override the default route `0.0.0.0/0` and to prevent routes learned by BGP (Route Propagation) to bypass the network virtual appliance.

## Known Issues

### Response 409: 409 Conflict, Error Code: AnotherOperationInProgress
The Azure API might throw an `Response 409: 409 Conflict`, `Error Code: AnotherOperationInProgress` when creating the subnet, this is due to dely in the Azure API when the `virtual network` resource is being updated and another `create/update/delete` is ran at the same time, in parallel or before the Azure API catches up with the previous operation. <br>

```powershell
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
│ RESPONSE 409: 409 Conflict
│ ERROR CODE: AnotherOperationInProgress
│ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
│ {
│   "error": {
│     "code": "AnotherOperationInProgress",
│     "message": "Another operation on this or dependent resource is in progress. To retrieve status of the operation use uri: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<GUID_REMOVED>/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/westeurope/operations/<GUID_REMOVED>?api-version=2023-04-01.",
│     "details": []
│   }
│ }
│ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

  This happens particularly when calling the module multiple times in the same terraform run, the workaround is to use explicit `depends_on` on the module resource to ensure that the module is ran sequentially e.g. <br>

  ```hcl
  module "subnet1" {
    source = "haflidif/alz-subnet/azurerm"
    ...ommitted for brevity
  }

  module "subnet2" {
    source = "haflidif/alz-subnet/azurerm"
    ...ommitted for brevity
    depends_on = [ module.subnet1 ]
  }
  ```
